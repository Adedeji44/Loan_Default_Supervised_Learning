# Loan_Default_Supervised_Learning

One of the leading financial institutions in India wants to leverage Machine Learning techniques to determine the client’s loan repayment abilities and take proactive steps to reduce the magnitude of exposure to default 

Goal: The goal of the problem is to predict whether a client will default on the loan payment or not, given the recent data of all the loan transactions. This can help the institution to distinguish future applicants who might default. For each ID in the Test Dataset, you must predict the “Default” level.

We are going to implement a number of Supervised Learning Classification Techniques such as LDA, QDA, Logistics regression and Boosting Classification Techniques to building a predictive model.
